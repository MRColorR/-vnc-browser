## Info :information_source:
VNC-Browser is a minimal, customizable, Linux-based Docker image designed to provide a lightweight environment for browsing the web via VNC.
This Docker image encapsulates a lightweight, VNC-accessible web browsing environment built on top of Debian and Alpine Linux. It packages a VNC server, noVNC for browser-based VNC access, and the Choromium and Firefox web browser, providing a compact solution for remotely browsing the web. Whether you're looking to browse securely or need a browsing environment within a containerized setup, VNC-Browser has you covered.

**Key Features ‚ú®**

- **VNC-Ready**: Ready for use with any VNC client or through a web browser using noVNC, offering a user-friendly interface.
- **Lightweight**: Built on Alpine Linux and debian-slim, ensuring minimal resource usage.
- **Customizable**: Set VNC password, initial website URL, auto-start settings for browser and xterm via environment variables.
- **Accessible**: Access the VNC server directly or through a browser using noVNC.

## Getting Started üö•

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Docker and containerization.

### Pull & Run :arrow_forward::
- Pull & Run the Image: `docker run -d -p 5900:5900 -p 6080:6080 mrcolorrain/vnc-browser`
  - Using a browser, you can connect to noVNC client on `localhost:6080` or from everywhere if properly configured using `HOSTIP:6080`
  - Using a VNC Client you can connect to  `localhost:5900` or from everywhere if properly configured using `HOSTIP:5900`

## Customization üé®
You can customize the settings of the Docker container by passing environment variables during the Docker run command. Here are some examples:
- Setting the initial website URL: `STARTING_WEBSITE_URL="https://www.google.com"`
- Setting the VNC password: `VNC_PASSWORD="mypassword"`
- Setting the resolution: `VNC_RESOLUTION="1280x720"`
- Enabling/disabling auto-start for the browser: `AUTO_START_BROWSER=true` or `AUTO_START_BROWSER=false`
- Enabling/disabling auto-start for xterm: `AUTO_START_XTERM=true` or `AUTO_START_XTERM=false`

- Example:
```sh
docker run -d -p 5900:5900 -p 6080:6080 -e STARTING_WEBSITE_URL="https://www.bing.com" -e VNC_PASSWORD="mypassword" -e VNC_RESOLUTION="1920x1080" -e AUTO_START_BROWSER=true -e AUTO_START_XTERM=true mrcolorrain/vnc-browser
